# BinaryCalculator
Calculator for binary arithmetic, and conversion between binary and decimal.

Originally created in November 2021, I made this calculator to assist myself with the large amount of binary arithmetic and convertions that were coming up in my programming classes at the time (Assembly, and Data Structures & Algorithms).
As I had recently learned in my Data Structures & Algorithms class, I used stacks and queues for Binary to Decimal conversions and vice versa, respectively.
Binary arithmetic calculations were performed with strings, or by converting the binary input to decimal & evaluating, before returning a binary conversion of the answer (see "Check" functions in BinaryCalculator.h).
